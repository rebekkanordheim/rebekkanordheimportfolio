                <h2>Hello there!</h2>
                <p>My name is Rebekka Nordheim and I am a 25 y/o Front-End Developer. I'm based in LÃ¸renskog and have currently finished my Higher Professional Degree in Front-End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    During my studies at Noroff, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of various web design principles, including UI and UX design, WCAG compliance, and responsive design techniques. Through hands-on learning, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, enabling me to create dynamic and user-centric web applications.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    From crafting visually appealing interfaces to ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across devices, my education at Noroff has equipped me with the knowledge and tools to excel in the ever-evolving field of front-end development.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    You can connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more about my journey and explore my latest projects on GitHub and Netlify.
